# PasswordGenerator
> A script made by me to generate secure passwords.

## Notes
To use the script, just download the executable, open it and enter the name of the website you want to create the password for, and then enter the length of the password you want to generate.
After that, the script will generate a password with the number of characters you chose, copy it to the clipboard and save it in a passwords.txt file along with the website you put.
